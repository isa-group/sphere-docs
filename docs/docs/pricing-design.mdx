# ðŸŽ¨ Creating a pricing from scratch

In this tutorial, we are going to design a pricing model from scratch using the CCSIM [^1] case study as an example.
CCSIM is a platform designed to help businesses optimize their Computing Continuum architecture. It provides powerful simulation tools that deliver accurate predictions and insights, enabling you to make informed decisions about your Computing Continuum infrastructure. With CCSIM, you can design, test, and refine your Computing Continuum setup in a risk-free environment before deployment [^2].

You can follow along with the tutorial in the Pricing2Yaml editor.

:::info Use of Pricing2Yaml in examples
Throughout this tutorial, you will encounter examples written in **Pricing2Yaml**, the syntax used in the SPHERE ecosystem to represent pricing information. These snippets are intended as your first introduction to the language. A deeper explanation will be provided in the [next tutorial](./pricing2yaml.md), which assumes you already have a pricing defined.
:::

:::warning Do your market research
**Conduct market research before designing your pricing.** Remember that you are competing 
in a landscape where user attention is divided among many other SaaS.

You can start by answering these questions:

- Who needs your product?
- Is your SaaS aimed at consumers (B2C), businesses (B2B), or both?
- Are there different user segments you should consider targeting?
:::


## 1. Identify your features

The first step is that you **distinguish** all the **features** of your SaaS and highlight any depenencies between them
if necessary.

In our running example here is the full list of our features:

- **IoT Environment Simulation**: Enables the simulation of customized IoT environments within a cloud continuum infrastructure.
- **QoS Tests**: Provides mechanisms for measuring performance metrics such as latency and response time.
- **Log Extraction**: Offers access to raw logs generated from simulations.
- **Basic Log Filtering**: Allows basic filtering by keywords within the logs.
- **Email Support**: Provides technical assistance via email.
- **SLA Uptime**: Guarantees a specific level of serviceavailability.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Facilitates integration of CCSIM simulations into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines, automating testing and deployment processes.
- **Advanced Log Filtering**: Offers sophisticated techniques for filtering and analyzing logs, aiding in-depth data
interpretation.
- **Mobile Simulation & UI Tests**: Allows CCSIM simulations to support mobile devices, including UI testing and
validation of performance and design in mobile applications.

Map every feature of your list into the `features` key value map of your Pricing2Yaml file. For now, assume that all features are boolean and disabled by default. Weâ€™ll update their default values later when we define the pricing structure. I strongly
recommend that you add a brief description for each feature to help users understand what offers:

```yaml

    description:  Allows CCSIM simulations to support mobile devices, including UI
      testing and validation of performance and design in mobile applications.
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    defaultValue: false
    type: DOMAIN
```

Once you have a complete list of your softwareâ€™s features, you need to identify the ones that directly address the primary 
problem you are trying to solve (aka *essential features*). In our case, CCSIM is a cloud continuum simulator, so the feature *IoT Environment Simulation* is the core foundation of the SaaS.

:::info Concept: Essential features
Essential features are core functionalities offered by the SaaS that must be available across all pricing plans. These features
usually have usage limits to encourage users to upgrade their subscription.
:::

Since *IoT Environment Simulation* is an essential feature change the `defaultValue` to `true`:

```yaml
features:
  iotEnvironmentSimulation:
    description: Enables the simulation of customized IoT environments within a cloud continuum infrastructure
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultValue: true
    type: DOMAIN
```

## 2. Define pricing structure

To structure your pricing, you should follow these steps:

1. Determine your *key features*
2. Define usage limits for your features
3. Select a pricing structure (plans, add-ons, plans and add-ons)
4. Distribute all the features across your selected pricing structure
5. Assign values to usage limits


### 2.1. Determine your key features

You have previously determine essential features that must be available in the lifespan of the 
SaaS. But again, you will need to go back and review all your features to figure out which ones are
*key features*.

:::info Concept: Key features
*Key features* are features that offer significant perceived value to users and are most likely to
encourage them to upgrade their subscription.
:::

Since CCSIM SaaS aims for individual with limited computing resources and enterprises
who want to test their infrastructures we can identify the the following
*key features*:

- **Advanced log filtering**, this feature is highly valuable for enteprise clients
who require detailed analysis of simulation results
- **CI/CD Integration**: essential for individuals and enterprises conducting multiple deployments
daily or seeking to improve their workflow automation
- **Mobile Simulation & UI Tests**: that is not so important for all the customer profiles but
crucial to others


### 2.2. Define usage limits for your features

:::warning
Skip this step if you don't need usage limits in your pricing
:::

If you have several features, you will probably want to set usage limits to them. This way,
clients may choose to upgrade their subscription to have more resouces, capacity... In other words, you will
introduce usage limits to turn a normal features into *key features*. 

In our CCSIM example given that *IoT Environment Simulation* is the most important feature we decided
to define some usage limits to it:

- **Simulations per Month**: Caps the number of simulations a user can run monthly.
- **Projects**: Limits the number of projects that can be managed simultaneously.
- **CPU Resources**: Defines the maximum CPU resources allocated per simulation.
- **RAM Allocation**: Specifies the maximum memory allocated per simulation.
- **Parallel Simulations**: Limits the number of simulations that can run concurrently.

Using this approach, **IoT Environment Simulation** becomes a *key feature* that encourage
users to move to higher subscription tiers.

```yaml
usageLimits:
  maxSimulation:
    description: number of simulations
    type: RENEWABLE
    valueType: NUMERIC
    defaultValue: 1
    unit: simulation
    period:
      value: 1
      unit: MONTH
    linkedFeatures:
      - iotEnvironmentSimulation
  maxProjects:
    description: number of projects that can be managed simultaneously.
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    valueType: NUMERIC
    defaultValue: 1
    unit: simulation
    trackable: true
    linkedFeatures:
      - iotEnvironmentSimulation
  cpuResources:
    description: maximum CPU resources allocated per simulation
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    valueType: NUMERIC
    defaultValue: 1
    unit: vCPU/simulation
    linkedFeatures:
      - iotEnvironmentSimulation
  ramAllocation:
    description: Specifies the maximum memory allocated per simulation
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    valueType: NUMERIC
    defaultValue: 1
    unit: GB/simulation
    linkedFeatures:
      - iotEnvironmentSimulation
  maxParallelSimulations:
    description: Limits the number of simulations that can run concurrently
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    valueType: NUMERIC
    defaultValue: 1
    linkedFeatures:
      - iotEnvironmentSimulation
```

We will also introduce an additional usage limit to *Mobile Simulation & UI Tests* feature
to restrict the number of mobile apps that can be simulated in CCSIM
per project, as this feature requires significant computational resources:

- **Mobile Apps per Project**, cap the number of mobile apps that can be used per project.

```yaml
  usageLimits:
    maxMobileAppsPerProject:
      description:  cap the number of mobile apps that can be used per project
      type: NON_RENEWABLE
      valueType: NUMERIC
      defaultValue: 1
      linkedFeatures:
      -  mobileSimulationAndUITests
```

### 2.3. Select a pricing structure

At this moment you have choose a structure that target the core customer of your SaaS you have 
several possibilites:

- Create a pricing that includes **only plans**: This is the most common type of pricing structure.
Features are distributed across multiple user segments, with each tier including the features
of the previous plan plus additional key features at a higher price.
- Create a pricing that includes **only add-ons**: This structure is particullarly useful
for large companies with a lot of products or features. Add-ons allow you to target specialized
customers who are seeking specific solutions to their problems. 
several products in your company and you want extra granularity to .
- Create a pricing that combines both **plans and add-ons**: This is another common pricing structure,
where plans serve as the primary pricing structure and add-ons act as a secondary model. Add-ons typically
expand the features of the plans by increasing usage limits or unlocking new functionalities.
- Create **separate pricings** for each distinct **product**: Large companies often use this model to
sell multiple products (for instance, Salesforce), especially when each product
covers different feature areas (Do not use this pattern unless you know what you are doing).

:::tip
A good rule of thumb is to distribute features into plans and use add-ons as needed, based on your user segments.
:::

:::tip
If you have a plan that includes many essential features consider structuring them around 
add-ons (for example, Okta) or to divide your *essential features* across diferrent pricings (for example, Salesforce)
:::

For the CCSIM simulator, our target audience includes individuals as well as small, medium, and large enterprises.
Therefore, we will offer three plans: *BASIC*, *PRO*, and *ENTERPRISE*:

- **BASIC** plan: aimed at users that need small-scale simulations with limited resources
- **PRO** plan: enhanced resources and features, making it suitable for larger projects and businesses that are growing
- **ENTERPRISE** plan: aimed at large organizations with complex simulation needs

We will complement the base plan with the following add-ons:
- **Mobile Simulation & UI Tests**: for those users that need to simulate mobile devices and mobile applications

### 2.4. Distribute all the features across your selected pricing structure

Once you have selected the pricing structure for your pricing you will have to distribute the features across
all the plans and add-ons. Start distributing key features and then proceed with the rest.

:::info Distribution heuristic

 If the selected pricing structure contains plans, each higher-tier plan must include at least all the features
 of its immediately lower-tier plan, plus at least one new **key feature**, which ensures that upgrading to a higher
 plan provides additional value to the customer. Furthermore, increasing some usage limits associated with a
 key feature can also enhance the value provided [^1].
 
 If none of these is possible or desirable, the pricing structure should shift towards including only add-ons,
 which allows each group of features to be independent [^1].
:::

In our CCSIM example, we include **CI/CD integration** key feature in the *PRO* plan to distinguish it from the *BASIC* plan, making it
better suited for larger projects and growing businesses that require greater workflow automation. Then, we include **Advanced log filtering**
key feature in the *ENTERPRISE* plan to those users that needs in-depth analysis of complex simulations.

```yaml
plans:
  BASIC:
    price: 0.0
    features: null
  PRO:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      ci/cdIntegration:
        value: true
  ENTERPRISE:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      ci/cdIntegration:
        value: true
      advancedLogFiltering:
        value: true
```

Lastly, we offer the **Mobile Simulation & UI Tests** key feature as a standalone add-on, targeting
organizations or individuals who require mobile device simulations.

```yaml
addOns:
  mobileSimulationsAndTests:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      mobileSimulationAndUITests:
        value: true
```

After assigning the key features, the remaining features should be distributed, ensuring that each plan
provides balanced value to users.

For example, in the case of CCSIM, features like **Log Filtering** or **QoS Tests** should be included in all plans because they are basic
simulator functionalities. While not strictly essential, leaving them out would prevent users from having a complete experience.
**Email support** feature will be provided to all plans, as it's important to assist users whenever they encounter issues with the simulator.
Limiting support only to higher-tier plans would be inappropriate and unfair for *BASIC* plan users.

```yaml
features:
  qosTests:
    description: Provides mechanisms for measuring performance metrics such as latency and response time
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultValue: true
    type: DOMAIN
  logExtraction:
    description: Offers access to raw logs generated from simulations
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultValue: true
    type: DOMAIN
  emailSupport:
    description: Provides technical assistance via email
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultValue: true
    type: DOMAIN
```

Since we also need to include the platform availability in our pricing so our
customers are aware of it, please update the **SLA Uptime** section to reflect the
uptime levels our platform will offer.

For CCSIM, we will guarantee the following availability levels for each plan:

- **BASIC**: 90% uptime
- **PRO**: 95% uptime
- **ENTERPRISE**: 99.99% uptime

```yaml
features:
  // highlight-start
  slaUptime:
    valueType: TEXT
    defaultValue: 90.0%
    type: DOMAIN
  // highlight-end
plans:
  BASIC:
    price: 0.0
    features: null
  PRO:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      // highlight-start
      slaUptime:
        value: 99.5%
      // highlight-end
  ENTERPRISE:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      // highlight-start
      slaUptime:
        value: 99.9%
      // highlight-end
```

Finally, we will enable the **Basic Log Filtering** feature only for the PRO plan and up, as this plan needs to differentiate from
the **BASIC** plan.

```yaml
plans:
  BASIC:
    price: 0.0
    features: null
  PRO:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      ci/cdIntegration:
        value: true
      // highlight-start
      basicLogFiltering:
        value: true
      // highlight-end

  ENTERPRISE:
    price: 0.0
    features:
      ci/cdIntegration:
        value: true
      advancedLogFiltering:
        value: true
      // highlight-start
      basicLogFiltering:
        value: true
      // highlight-end
```

### 2.5. Assign values to usage limits

The last step in structuring a pricing is to set the usage limit values according to the expected software
usage for each user segment. Assigning appropriate usage limits requires that the person defining these values
understands how users behave based on their usage patterns backed up by data.

Setting usage limits depends on several factors:
- External services restrictions (External APIs, hosting provider restrictions)
- Performance of your SaaS
- Market trends
- SaaS OpEx and SaaS gross profit margin
- etc...

:::info
In general, the more information you have, the more confidently you can determine appropriate values for those limits.
:::

In the CCSIM example, **Simulations per Month** has been estimated that 15, 25, and 40 simulations per month for the usage 
are the optimal values for each plan.
**Projects**  usage limit also be restricted to help balance the platform's operating costs with 
10, 30 and 50 for each plan.

```yaml
usageLimits:
  maxSimulation:
    defaultValue: 15
    unit: simulation/month
  maxProjects:
    defaultValue: 10
    unit: project
plans:
  BASIC:
    price: 0.0
    features: null
    usageLimits: null
  PRO:
    price: 0.0
    usageLimits:
      maxSimulation:
        value: 25
      maxProjects:
        value: 30
  ENTERPRISE:
    price: 0.0
    usageLimits:
      maxSimulation:
        value: 40
      maxProjects:
        value: 50
```

Regarding **CPU Resources**, the allocation will be as follows: 96 vCPUs for *BASIC* plan, 
128 vCPUs for *PRO* plan and 192 vCPUs for *ENTERPRISE* plan.
The same applies to **RAM Allocation**, which will be set at 192 GB, 512 GB, and 768 GB, respectively.
The previous values were calculated based on AWS EC2 instance limitations and the hardware
requirements of the SaaS.

```yaml
usageLimits:
  cpuResources:
    defaultValue: 96
    unit: vCPU
  ramAllocation:
    defaultValue: 192
    unit: GB
plans:
  BASIC:
    usageLimits: null
  PRO:
    usageLimits:
      cpuResources:
        value: 128
      ramAllocation:
        value: 512
  ENTERPRISE:
    usageLimits:
      cpuResources:
        value: 192
      ramAllocation:
        value: 768
```

Finally, the **Parallel Simulations** usage limit will be set to 3 only for the *ENTERPRISE* plan,
as this user segment requires more resources for their use cases.

```yaml
plans:
 ENTERPRISE:
    usageLimits:
      maxParallelSimulations:
        value: 3

## 3. Set pricings for your pricing


After creating the structure of the pricing, the final part of the process involves setting prices to plans/add-ons.
To do so, a pricing strategy that aligns with the domain expert understanding of the market and strategic objectives
must be selected.

Common strategies include:
- **Demand-driven pricing scheme**: sets prices based on the provider's understanding of customer-perceived values.
- **Penetration pricing scheme**: involves setting low prices to capture market share among price-sensitive customers
- **Skimming pricing scheme**: targets less price-sensitive customers with initially high prices that are gradually reduced
- **Derivative-follower pricing scheme**: adjusts prices based on sales outcomes using trial and error to pinpoint the optimal price.

:::tip
Findings suggest that penetration and skimming strategies generally outperform the derivative-follower approach. However,
when data on customer-perceived values is available, the demand-driven approach proves to be the most effective.
:::

To finalize the pricing of CCSIM, we will calculate the operational expenditure (OpEx)
required to support a user who fully utilizes each plan, ensuring the platform remains sustainable in the long term.
We will apply a demand-driven pricing approach to adjust base costs, adding a profit margin at the final price.
