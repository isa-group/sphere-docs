## üì¶ Installation

The **Pricing4SaaS** suite consists of two libraries that can be used independently or in combination to meet your specific needs. This guide provides an overview of the installation process for each library, ensuring you can quickly integrate **Pricing4SaaS** into your SaaS platform.

## Pricing4Java

This Java-based toolkit is designed to enhance the server-side functionality by enabling the seamless integration of pricing plans into the application logic.

:::info

Pricing4Java GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/isa-group/Pricing4Java)

:::
:::tip

We encourage to use the latest version of Pricing4Java, available in [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.isa-group/Pricing4Java)

:::

The package have been built to be used with maven. To install it, just add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.isa-group</groupId>
        <artifactId>Pricing4Java</artifactId>
        <version>{pricing4java-version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Pricing4React

The aim of this package is to provide some simple and easy to use components for react that allows UI feature toggling driven by pricing features. It is designed to be used in combination with `Pricing4Java`, as its manages the toggling of features based on the JWT structure generated by the backend library.

To install the package in your React application, just run:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install pricing4react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add pricing4react
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## üîß Setting up the spring project with Princing4Java

### 1. Configure your application class to scan Pricing4Java

```java title="src/main/java/org/example/MyFirstPricingDrivenSaaSApplication.java"
// highlight-next-line
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"io.github.isagroup", "org.springframework.samples.myapplication"})
public class MyFirstPricingDrivenSaaSApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MyFirstPricingDrivenSaaSApplication.class, args);
  }

}
```

### 2. Declare a pricing configuration file

Pricing4Java uses a YAML file written in the [Pricing2Yaml](../../api/pricing-description-languages/Pricing2Yaml/the-pricing2yaml-syntax) syntax to represent and manage the whole pricing. Place the pricing configuration file anywhere inside the folder `src/main/resources`. Create the file `pricing.yml` within such directory and copy the snippet below, which shows a basic structure of such syntax:

```yaml title="src/main/resources/pricing.yml"
saasName: My First Pricing Driven SaaS
version: "1.0"
day: 10
month: 03
year: 2024
currency: USD
hasAnnualPayment: false
features:
  cloudStorage:
    description: Store your personal files with our cloud storage service
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    defaultValue: true
    type: DOMAIN
    expression: userContext['cloudStorageUse'] < planContext['cloudStorage']
    serverExpression: userContext['cloudStorageUse'] <= planContext['cloudStorage']
  adminDashboard:
    description: Manage your users easily with our dashbord for administrators
    valueType: BOOLEAN
    defaultValue: false
    type: MANAGEMENT
    expression: userContext['cloudStorageUse'] < planContext['cloudStorage']
    serverExpression: userContext['cloudStorageUse'] <= planContext['cloudStorage']
usageLimits:
  cloudStorageMaxCapacity:
    description: This is the usage limit imposed to the cloudStorage feature
    valueType: NUMERIC
    unit: GB
    defaultValue: 1
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    linkedFeatures:
      - cloudStorage
plans:
  FREE:
    description: The free plan is allowed to all users
    monthlyPrice: 0
    unit: user/month
  PREMIUM:
    description: Unlock all our features with the premium plan
    monthlyPrice: 15
    unit: user/month
    features:
      adminDashboard:
        value: true
    usageLimits:
      cloudStorageMaxCapacity:
        value: 10
addOns:
  extraCloudStorageCapacity:
    availableFor:
      - FREE
      - PREMIUM
    price: 20
    unit: user/month
    usageLimitsExtensions:
      cloudStorageMaxCapacity:
        value: 100
```

### 2.1 (OPTIONAL) Create a unit test to validate the Pricing2Yaml file

If you are interested in checking if your YAML file is correctly formatted, you can implement a test to do so. Here it is an example:

```java
@Test
void parsePostmanYamlToClassTest() {
    PricingManager pricingManager = YamlUtils.retrieveManagerFromYaml("{NAME_OF_YOUR_FILE}.yml");
}
```

The test will fail if the YAML file does not correctly follow the [Pricing2Yaml syntax](../../api/pricing-description-languages/Pricing2Yaml/the-pricing2yaml-syntax.md), and will throw an exception explaining the problem.

### 3. Configure the pricing context

Once the pricing configuration file is ready, the next step is to create a component that extends the [PricingContext](../../api/Pricing4SaaS/Pricing4Java/pricing-context) abstract class. This component will be the key to manage all the pricing configuration, including user context evaluation, JWT generation, pricing operations, etc.

```java title=title="src/main/java/org/example/config/PricingConfiguration.java"
@Component
public class PricingConfiguration extends PricingContext {

    @Override
    public String getJwtSecret() {
        return "mySecret";
    }

    @Override
    public String getConfigFilePath() {
        // Path relative to src/main/resources folder
        return "pricing.yml";
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getUserContext() {

        Map<String, Object> userContext = new HashMap<>();

        // Add the logic to retrieve all the data needed within the user context, such as his current usage of the feature cloudStorage.

        return userContext;
    }

    @Override
    public String getUserPlan() {

        // Should be replace by the logic that returns the plan name of the current user.
        return "BASIC";
    }

}

```

### 4. Configure the security context

After the `PricingConfiguration` is set, you must add a `@Bean` [RenewTokenFilter](../../api/Pricing4SaaS/Pricing4Java/renew-token-filter) in
some configuration class with annotation `@Configuration`. This filter will be responsible for checking the JWT token in every request, keeping your frontend's feature evaluation context up to date with your backend's.

```java title="src/main/java/org/example/config/WebConfig.java"

import io.github.isagroup.filters.RenewTokenFilter;

@Configuration
public class WebConfig {
    // Other configurations...

    @Bean
    public RenewTokenFilter renewJwtTokenFilter() {
      return new RenewTokenFilter();
    }

    // Other configurations...
}
```

:::warning

If you have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) within your application, we recommend to check the [RenewTokenFilter documentation](../../api/Pricing4SaaS/Pricing4Java/renew-token-filter).

:::

## üöÄ Adding dynamic feature toggles with Pricing4React

### 1. Implement a filter to manage the JWT

In order to run Pricing4React, you have to store the JWT generated by Pricing4Java in the local storage of the browser with the key `pricingToken`. This operation can be performed after a valid response have been received from the backend when login/registering an user.

### 2. Use Pricing4React components

The package provides a component that contains almost the whole logic you need to manage your toggles: `Feature`. This component allows to show or hide its children depending on the evaluation of a pricing feature. It has the prop `expression`, which reads from the JWT the evaluation of the feature. You can use the `feature` function to locate features by their key.

Depending on the context, it can have up to four children:

- `On`: This component will be shown if the feature is evaluated to `true`.
- `Default`: This component will render its children if the evaluation of the feature performed in `On` component is `false`.
- `Loading`: This component will render its children while the evaluation of the feature is being performed.
- `ErrorFallback`: This component will render its children if an error occurs while the evaluation of the feature is being performed.

The evaluation of a feature that has the key `cloudStorage` would be:

```jsx
import {
  Default,
  ErrorFallback,
  Feature,
  On,
  Loading,
  feature,
} from "pricing4react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Feature expression={feature("cloudStorage")}>
      <On>
        <p>CloudStorage feature is enabled</p>
      </On>
      <Default>
        <p>CloudStorage feature is disabled</p>
      </Default>
      <Loading>
        <p>Loading...</p>
      </Loading>
      <ErrorFallback>
        <p>An error occurred</p>
      </ErrorFallback>
    </Feature>
  );
}
```

In this case, the `feature` function (used within the `expression` prop) is in charge of retrieving the result of the feature evaluation (as a boolean), saved inside the user JWT. It just need the key of the feature to find it. <!-- However, the `expression` prop can also receive a boolean condition or value to be evaluated. -->
