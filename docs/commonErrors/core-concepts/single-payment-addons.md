### Question

Can I include an add-on that does not require renewal after purchase?

### Answer

**One-time payments are currently not supported by the iPricing metamodel**, and there are no plans to incorporate this capability in the near future. This decision is **deliberate** and is grounded in the **subscription-based** revenue strategy that underpins most Software as a Service offerings and represents the prevailing industry standard. 

Under this paradigm, users are charged **periodically** rather than through a single upfront payment.

In this setting, the set of plans and add-ons selected by a user jointly defines a subscription. The **subscription price** is computed as the aggregation of the individual prices associated with each selected plan and add-on, and this total amount is billed on a **recurring basis**. The periodicity of the charge is determined by the billing cycle configured for the subscription, such as monthly or annual billing.

The requested approach, which relies on a **single, non-renewable payment** to obtain access to a specific feature, is more consistent with a **license-based** revenue model. In such models, a one-time payment grants perpetual access to a given software component or capability. This assumption differs fundamentally from the subscription-oriented principles and operational assumptions that structure the SPHERE ecosystem.
