- **optional**
- Fied type: `seq` of add-ons names

In the current add-on that you are defining specify one or more add-ons that cannot be purchased
together.

In this example we have two addOns available for plan `BASIC` that are `addOnA` and `addOnB`.
Since `addOnA` excludes `addOnB` purchasing plan `BASIC`, `addOnA` and `addOnB` is not posible.
It is valid to purchase `BASIC` and `addOnA` and `BASIC` and `addOnB`.

```yaml
plans:
  BASIC:
addOns:
  addOnA:
    availableFor:
      - BASIC
    excludes:
      - addOnB
  addOnB:
    availableFor:
      - BASIC
```

<VersionTable name="addOns.<name>.excludes" libraries={[true, true]} />
