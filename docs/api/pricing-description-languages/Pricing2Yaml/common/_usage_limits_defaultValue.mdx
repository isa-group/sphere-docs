- **required**
- Field type is `bool` if `valueType` is set to `BOOLEAN`
- Field type is `int` if `valueType` set to `NUMERIC`
- Field type is `str` if `valueType` is set to `TEXT`

This field holds the default value of your usage limit. All default values are shared in your plan and addons. You can
override your usage limits values in `plans.<plan_name>.usageLimits` or in `addOns.<addOn_name>.usageLimits`
section of your pricing.

To help you understand how overriding usage limits works, imagine you have the following pricing
matrix:

|               | SILVER | GOLD | PLATINUM |
| ------------- | ------ | ---- | -------- |
| collaborators | 1      | 6    | 10       |

If you want your `collaborators` usage limit to be different in your `GOLD` and `PLATINUM` plans you
will do the following using Pricing2Yaml syntax:

```yaml
usageLimits:
  collaborators:
    valueType: NUMERIC
    defaultValue: 1
plans:
  SILVER:
    usageLimits: null
  GOLD:
    usageLimits:
      collaborators:
        value: 6
  PLATINUM:
    usageLimits:
      collaborators:
        value: 10
```

**Libraries support**
