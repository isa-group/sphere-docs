import { VersionTable } from "@site/src/components/common";

- **optional**
- Field type: `seq` of addon names

A list of addon to be subscribed in order to purchase the current addon.

Imagine that your addon `SECURITY` depends on `ENTERPRISE` addon. That
means that in order to include in your subscription the `SECURITY` addon you also have to include
`ENTERPRISE` addon.

That way you can subscribe to `ENTERPRISE` or `ENTERPRISE` and `SECURITY` but no exclusively to
`SECURITY` addon.

```yaml
addOns:
  ENTERPRISE:
  SECURITY:
    dependsOn:
      - ENTERPRISE
```

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable name="addOns.<name>.dependsOn" libraries={[true, true]} />
