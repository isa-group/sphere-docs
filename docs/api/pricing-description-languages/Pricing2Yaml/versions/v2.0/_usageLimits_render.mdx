import { VersionTable } from "@site/src/components/common";

- **optional**
- Field type: one of `AUTO`, `DISABLED`, `ENABLED`; if not provided `render` is set to `AUTO` by default

Choose the behaviour when displaying the usage limit of the pricing. This field will only take effect on the [Pricing2Yaml editor](https://sphere.score.us.es/editor).

```yaml
usageLimits:
  usageLimit1:
    render: DISABLED
```

Depending on the selected value, the usage limit will be rendered differently:

- If `render` is set to **AUTO**, no action is taken.
- If `render` is set to **ENABLED**, a row will be added to the pricing with the usage limitâ€™s name and values, rather than the name of the feature it is linked to (regardless of whether the linked feature is even set to DISABLED).
- If `render` is set to **DISABLED**, no row will be displayed in the pricing for it. If it was the only usage limit associated with a feature, then the feature itself will appear in the table with its values.

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable name="usageLimits.<name>.render" libraries={[false, true]} />
