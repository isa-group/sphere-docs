Plan or add-on price can be computed by specifying a expression using variables.
Think of variables as just a convenient way of storing parts of your equation to
reduce the length of plan or add-on expresssion. You can uses variables
in price expressions by prefixing them with a `#`.

Consider the following `yaml` that uses variables in the expression:

```yaml
plans:
  PRO:
    price: 9.99
  ENTERPRISE:
    price: "5 * #x" # 5 * 3
variables:
  x: 3
```

Here `ENTERPRISE` plan uses variable `x` inside of the expression by prefixing it with `#`.
Then variables `x` will be interpolated in the equation so equation will be
`5 * 3` which results in `15.00`.
