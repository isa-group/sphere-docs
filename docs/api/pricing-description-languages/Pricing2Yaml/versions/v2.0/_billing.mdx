- **optional**, if a map of billing is not provided `billing` will be set
  by default with:

```yaml
billing:
  monthly: 1
```

- Field type: `map` of `float` inside range `(0..1]`

The prices of plans and add-ons may vary based on the billing option chosen by the user when subscribing.
Longer subscription periods offer greater discounts. `billing` field holds a map
of monthly price reductions to be applied to `price` field of plans and add-ons.
You are free to put inside the map the billing name that you wish.

Price reductions must be positive values greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.

Consider the following example:

```yaml
billing:
  monthly: 1
  semester: 0.95
  annual: 0.90
plans:
  STANDARD:
    price: 10.00
addOns:
  ULTRA:
    price: 15.00
```

Here `STANDARD` plan costs `10.00` monthly, `9.5` monhtly if billing
by semester and `9.00` monthly if billing annually.
`ULTRA` add-on costs `15.00` monthly if billing monthly, `14.25` monthly if billing by semester and
`13.5` monthly if billing annually.
