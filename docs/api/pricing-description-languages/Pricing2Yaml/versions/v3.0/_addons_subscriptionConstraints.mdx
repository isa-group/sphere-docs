- **optional**, if a map is not provided, and add-on is scalable, `subscriptionConstraints` will be set
  by default with:

```yaml
addOns:
  sampleAddon:
    ...
    subscriptionConstraints:
      minQuantity: 1
      maxQuantity: .inf
      quantityStep: 1
```

- Field type: map containing constraints to contract scalable add-ons, i.e. those that only extend usage limits.

A list of addon to be subscribed in order to purchase the current addon.

A map of conditions to be satisfied in order to purchase the current addon.

:::warning
The `subscriptionConstraints` field is only available for scalable add-ons, meaning that not scalable add-ons ignore this field.
:::

**EXAMPLE:** Imagine that your addon `extraSeats` imposes the following constraints:

- `minQuantity` = 1
- `maxQuantity` = 10
- `quantityStep` = 2

That means that you can subscribe to `extraSeats` only if you choose a quantity between 1 and 10, and the quantity must be a multiple of 2.

```yaml
addOns:
  extraSeats:
    price: 10.00
    ...
    subscriptionConstraints:
      minQuantity: 1
      maxQuantity: 10
      quantityStep: 2
```
