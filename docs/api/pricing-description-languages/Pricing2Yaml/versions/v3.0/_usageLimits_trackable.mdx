- **required**, if usageLimits.\<name\>.type is `NON_RENEWABLE`. This field will be set by default with:
```yaml
usageLimits:
  sampleLimit:
    ...
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    trackable: false
```

Flag indicating whether the usage of a feature linked to a "NON_RENEWABLE" usage limit must be tracked within the user’s subscription. If true, the system records usage to ensure the limit is not exceeded during feature evaluations.

**EXAMPLE:** If you own an online conference service –like zoom– you may have this two NON_RENEWABLE limits:

- `maxMeetingDuration` (e.g. 1 hour)
- `maxRecordingsCloudStorage` (e.g. 10 GB)

The former do not need to be tracked within the user subscription, since it's a limit that affects meetings.
However, the latter must be tracked, since it affects users theirselves and their storage. 

Therefore, you can model this situation as follows:

```yaml
usageLimits:
  maxMeetingDuration:
    ...
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    trackable: false
  maxRecordingsCloudStorage:
    ...
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
    trackable: true
```
