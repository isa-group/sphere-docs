- **required**
- Field type: `str`
- Supported values: **one of** `NON_RENEWABLE`
  `RENEWABLE` , `RESPONSE_DRIVEN` or `TIME_DRIVEN`

Field that indicates the type of usage limit based on our clasification of usage limits.

**NON_RENEWABLE**: define a static limit towards which the user approaches, and that will
remain until the end of the subscription.

```yaml
usageLimits:
  uploadSizeLimit:
    type: NON_RENEWABLE
```

**RENEWABLE**: their limit is reset after a period of time, could be a day, week, month...

```yaml
usageLimits:
  githubCodepacesCoreHours:
    type: RENEWABLE
```

**RESPONSE_DRIVEN**: represent a limit where user consumes more or less of his quota depending
on the computational cost of the SaaS associated with the request.

```yaml
usageLimits:
  flowCredits:
    description: "Number of flows executions steps included per month"
    unit: credit/month
    type: RESPONSE_DRIVEN
```

**TIME_DRIVEN**: with this type the quota is consumed by usage time, and is normally
combined with a non-renewable limit.

```yaml
compileTimeoutLimit:
  description:
    This is how much time you get to compile your project on the Overleaf servers.
    You may need additional time for longer or more complex projects.
  type: TIME_DRIVEN
```
