- **optional**
- Field type: `bool`, `int` or `str` depending on the `valueType` of the usage limit

Every plan that you model will have by default all usage limits `defaultValue`. You
can customize it by putting a value in it.

In the following example `collaborators` usage limit is overridden by `STANDARD`.

```yaml
usageLimits:
  collaborators:
    defaultValue: 1
addOns:
  STANDARD:
    usageLimits:
      collaborators:
        value: 6
```

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable
  name="plans.<name>.usageLimits.<name>.value"
  libraries={[true, true]}
/>
