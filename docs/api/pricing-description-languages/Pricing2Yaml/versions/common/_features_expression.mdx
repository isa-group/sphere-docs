import { VersionTable } from "@site/src/components/common";

A boolean expression defining the conditions under which the feature is enabled. This expression can reference other features and usage limits using the `pricingContext` and `subscriptionContext` objects.

Respectively, the `pricingContext` will be an object with the following structure:
```typescript
{
  features: {
    <feature-name>: boolean | string,
    ...
  },
  usageLimits: {
    <limit-name>: number | boolean,
    ...
  }
}
```

while the `subscriptionContext` will have the following structure:

```typescript
{
  <usage-level-name>: number,
  ...
}
```

With this in mind, the `expression` field can be used to define the conditions under which a feature is enabled.

For example, if we have a feature `feature1` that should only be enabled if the user has not exceeded the usage limit `usageLimit1`, the expression would be:

```yaml
feature1:
  description: Pets description
  valueType: BOOLEAN
  defaultValue: true
  expression: subscriptionContext['usageLimit1'] < pricingContext['usageLimits']['usageLimit1']
  ...
```

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable name="features.<name>.expression" libraries={[true, true]} />
