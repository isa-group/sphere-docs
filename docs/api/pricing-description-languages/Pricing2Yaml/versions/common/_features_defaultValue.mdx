- **required**
- Field type is `bool` if `valueType` is set to `BOOLEAN`
- Field type is `int` if `valueType` set to `NUMERIC`
- Field type is `str` or `seq` of **payment methods** if `valueType` is set to `TEXT`

This field holds the default value of your feature. All default values are shared in your plan and addons. You can
override your features values in `plans.<plan_name>.features` or in `addOns.<addOn_name>.features`
section of your pricing.

Supported **payment methods** are: `CARD`, `GATEWAY`, `INVOICE`, `ACH`, `WIRE_TRANSFER` or `OTHER`.

To help you understand how overriding features works, imagine you have the following pricing
matrix:

|                 | SILVER | GOLD   | PLATINUM |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| supportPriority | LOW    | MEDIUM | HIGH     |

If you want your `supportPriority` to be different in your `GOLD` and `PLATINUM` plans you
will do the following using Pricing2Yaml syntax:

```yaml
features:
  supportPriority:
    valueType: TEXT
    defaultValue: LOW
plans:
  SILVER:
    features: null
  GOLD:
    features:
      supportPriority:
        value: MEDIUM
  PLATINUM:
    features:
      supportPriority:
        value: HIGH
```

Notice that `SILVER` features are `null`, meaning that, `supportPriority`
will have the value `LOW` as you have previously define it in the `features` block.

**Libraries support**

<VersionTable name="features.<name>.defaultValue" libraries={[true, true]} />
