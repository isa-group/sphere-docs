- **optional**
- Field type: `map`

A map containing the plans of your pricing. Each entry of this map
will be the name of the corresponding plan.

```yaml
saasName: Petclinic
plans:
  BASIC:
  GOLD:
  PLATINUM:
  # ...
```

:::info
You have to specify at least `plans` or `addOns`. A combination
of both also works.
