# ➕ Create a Contract

In **SPACE**, contracts represent the legal and technical agreements between the SaaS provider (who manages SPACE) and the end users of the SaaS application.  
They define **who the customer is, what are they subscribed to, and how billing is managed.**

Unlike services or pricings, **contracts can only be created programmatically** via the **SPACE API**. It is an action that is expected to be performed by the managed service programmatically.

---

## 📖 Example Scenario

Suppose a customer has purchased the **GOLD plan** of **PetClinic**.  
After verifying their payment in your billing system, you must **register the contract in SPACE** so that:

- The subscription state can be tracked.
- Feature access can be enforced.

---

## 🧾 Required Fields

To create a contract, you need to provide:

- **User Information**: at least `userId` and `username` of the subscriber.
- **Billing Period**: renewal policy (`autoRenew`) and cycle length (`renewalDays`).
- **Contracted Service(s)**: the service(s) and pricing version(s) the contract refers to.
- **Subscription Plans**: which plan the user has subscribed to for each service.
- **Subscription Add-ons (optional)**: any additional features the user purchased.

For more details on the contract schema, see the [API Reference](../space-api.mdx).

---

## 0. Prerequisites

- A valid **API key** with at least the `MANAGER` role. See [SPACE Roles](../space-roles.mdx) for details.
- The **userId** of the subscriber. This depends on the identification system the managed service employs.

:::info Notes

- `usageLevels` are automatically initialized and tracked by SPACE.
- `history` will contain the lifecycle events of the contract (e.g., upgrades, downgrades, cancellations).
- Contracts are **immutable in principle**: any change creates a new version in the history log.
