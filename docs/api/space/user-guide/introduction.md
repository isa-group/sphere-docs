## 🐕 Our running example: PetClinic

The figure below illustrates a pricing for PetClinic. It includes **ten features** regulated by **three plans** and **three add-ons** (seven by plans, three by add-ons) and imposes **usage limits on the ***pets*** and ***visits*** features**. Moreover, some add-ons are not available for all plans. For instance, *Pets Dashboard* can be contracted only if the user subscribes to the *PLATINUM* plan.
