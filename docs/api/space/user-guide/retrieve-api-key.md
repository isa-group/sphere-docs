# ðŸ”‘ Retrieve API Key

To interact with **SPACE** â€”whether through its API or via its SDKsâ€” you need an `apiKey` tied to a user account.  
This key acts as the **authentication token** for all requests.

Each SPACE user automatically receives a **unique API key** when their account is created.

---

## ðŸ“¥ How to Retrieve Your API Key

1. **Login** into SPACE.  
2. Go to the **Access Control** section in the left sidebar.  
3. Locate the user account you want to use for authentication.  
4. Copy the corresponding **API key** and use it in your service or SDK configuration.

:::warning Important
- Keep your API key **secret** â€” it grants access based on the userâ€™s role (`EVALUATOR`, `MANAGER`, or `ADMIN`).  
- If an API key is compromised, revoke it by deleting the user account.  
- Never expose your API key directly in client-side code.
