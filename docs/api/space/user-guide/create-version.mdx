# âž• Create a Pricing Version

One of SPACEâ€™s most powerful features is its ability to act as a **Pricing Version Control System (PVCS)**.  

This means you can **easily track changes, activate or archive pricings, and evolve your SaaS offerings** without losing historical data.

    2025-08-13: Launch of Petclinic V2
    202X-XX-XX : Launch of Petclinic VX
```

The timeline above shows a sample evolution of **PetClinic**. Each new version represents an update to its pricing.

In the examples below, the **differences between Petclinic V1 and V2** are highlighted in grey.

## ðŸš€ Uploading a New Pricing Version

Follow these steps to upload a new pricing version for an existing service in **SPACE**:

---

### 0. Prerequisites

- You must already have a service created in SPACE.  
  
  ðŸ‘‰ If not, see [Create a Service](./create-service.md) first.

### 1. Open the Services Management Panel

Go to the **Services Management** tab in the left sidebar.  

Select the service you want to update (in this example, **PetClinic**).

![Services Management View With PetClinic](../../../static/img/space/user-guides/services-management-with-service.png)

### 2. Access the Service Details

Click on the **service card** to open its details.

Here youâ€™ll find the list of existing pricing versions for that service.

![Add pricing version button](../../../static/img/space/user-guides/add-pricing-version.png)

### 3. Add a New Version

Click the **â‹® (three-dot menu)** at the top-right corner and select **Add Version**.

A dialog will appear asking you to upload a **Pricing2Yaml** file.

:::tip
Alternatively, you can **upload your pricing to SPHERE** and use the link of the desired pricing version to instantiate the service. See [this guide](../../sphere/user-guides/upload-pricing.md) for more details.
:::

![Add version dialog](../../../static/img/space/user-guides/add-new-version-dialog.png)

:::danger Requirements

The pricing you upload must follow these rules in order to be added to the service:

- The `saasName` field must match your serviceâ€™s name exactly.
- The `version` field must be unique compared to existing versions.

If your **Pricing2Yaml** file (no matter whether it has been provided as a link) contains a different `saasName` than the current service, SPACE will reject it with an error.
:::

## 4. Confirm Upload

Click **Upload** to finish.  

---

SPACE will create the new pricing version and automatically link it to your service.  
Youâ€™ll see it appear in the **versions list** inside the service details page.
