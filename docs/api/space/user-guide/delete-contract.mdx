# 🗑️ Delete Contract

Contracts in **SPACE** represent the agreements between your SaaS and its end users.  

While most contracts remain active until their billing period ends or are renewed automatically, there are situations where you may need to **terminate a contract manually** — for example, when a payment fails.

## ⚙️ How to Terminate a Contract

Contract termination can only be performed **programmatically via the SPACE API**.  
The endpoint for this operation is:

```http
DELETE /api/v1/contracts/{userId}
```

Where `userId` is the identifier of the end user whose contract you want to terminate.

---

## 0. Prerequisites

-	🔑 A valid `ADMIN` API key.
-	🆔 The userId of the contract owner.

## 1. Simplified Request

```http
DELETE /api/v1/contracts/<userId> HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5403
Accept: application/json
x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

## 2. Using curl

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
  http://localhost:5403/api/v1/contracts/<userId>
```

---

## ✅ Example Response

If the termination succeeds, SPACE will confirm the deletion of the contract and return the contract’s final state before being removed:

```json
{
  "id": "68908c121570b332f02d05d9",
  "userContact": {
    "userId": "72ee0357-e34b-4d8f-9e0f-b710391cb298",
    "username": "petclinicuser01"
  },
  "billingPeriod": {
    "startDate": "2025-08-04T10:31:46.010Z",
    "endDate": "<current-date>",
    "autoRenew": true,
    "renewalDays": 365
  },
  "contractedServices": {
    "petclinic": "2025-3-26"
  },
  "subscriptionPlans": {
    "petclinic": "GOLD"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔄 What Happens After Termination?

- 🚫 The contract is removed from SPACE.
- ❌ The user immediately loses access to all features defined by that contract.
- 🔐 Any pricing tokens (pricingToken) previously issued for this user become invalid.

:::warning Important
Once a contract is terminated, it cannot be restored.
To re-enable the user, you must create a new contract via the API.
:::

Given the impact of permanently removing a contract, deletion is not always the best option. For example, if the SaaS offers a free subscription —i.e., a combination of plans and add-ons at no cost— it is often considered best practice to **novate the contract to this free subscription** rather than deleting it.
