# Services and Pricings management

## SaaS providers with multiple services

Driven by market opportunities SaaS providers tend to innovate their products and offer new
features to their consumers progresivelly, rolling out extra features with add-ons and a fixed
pricing subscribing to a plan.

At some point the choice architect[^1] involved in the pricing may split the service into separated services
to reduce user cognitive overload in decision making.

To support these *multi-service* models *iSubscription* model propose a machine readable specification to 
solve this problem. Here is a very simple class diagram showing *iSubscription* model:

```mermaid

title: Simplified iSubscription metamodel

classDiagram
    Subscription "1" -- "1..*" Service : includes
    Service *-- "0..1" Plan
    Service *-- "0..*" AddOn
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="single-service" label="Single service subscription">
  
  Overleaf is a cloud latex editor:
  
    ```mermaid
    ---
    title:  A subscription with Overleaf Standard and AI Assist add-on
    ---
    classDiagram
        class Sub["<u>Single: Subscription</u>"]
        class Overleaf["<u>Overleaf: Service</u>"]
        
        class Plan["<u>Standard: Plan</u>"]
        class AddOn["<u>AI Assist: AddOn</u>"]
        
        Sub -- Overleaf
        Overleaf -- Plan
        Overleaf -- AddOn
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="multi-service" label="Multiple service subscription" default>
  
    For example Cake.com offers the following services:
    - [Plaky](https://plaky.com): tasks and project management tool
    - [Pumble](https://pumble.com): team communication tool
    - [Clockify](https://clockify.com): time tracking tool

    Within a single subscription, you can purchase plans for each service individually:
  
    ```mermaid
    ---
    title:  A subscription with Placky FREE, Pumble PRO and Clockify STANDARD
    ---
    classDiagram
        class Sub["<u>Multi: Subscription</u>"]
        class Placky["<u>Placky: Service</u>"]
        class Pumble["<u>Pumble: Service</u>"]
        class Clockify["<u>Clockify: Service</u>"]
            
        class PlackyPlan["<u>Placky FREE: Plan</u>"]
        class PumblePlan["<u>Pumble PRO: Plan</u>"]
        class ClockifyPlan["<u>Clockify STANDARD: Plan</u>"]
            
        Sub -- Placky
        Placky -- PlackyPlan
        Sub -- Pumble
        Pumble -- PumblePlan
        Clockify -- ClockifyPlan
        Sub -- Clockify
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>





We can instantiate previous class diagram into an **object diagram** with our Cake.com products:



## Service management

In order to create a service go to **Services Management** tab located at the left side panel and
click on **Add Service** button:

![Services Management](/img/space/starter-guide/services-management.png)

A dialog will appear prompting you to upload a YAML file. The file must follow the **Pricing2Yaml** specification.

![Add Service dialog](/img/space/starter-guide/add-new-service-dialog.png)


Hit **Upload** button and a service will be created and your pricing will be automatically linked.

![Service uploaded](/img/space/starter-guide/services-management-with-service.png)

:::info
When you upload a new service, its name is taken from the `saasName` field in the uploaded **Pricing2Yaml** file.

## Pricing management

SPACE includes a pricing version control system allowing you to easily track changes
and archive or active pricings if necessary.

```mermaid

```

These represent two different versions of **Petclinic** SaaS, a fictional veterinary management application.
Petclinic V1 and V2 pricing **changes** are highlighted in **grey**:

### Versions

If you want to upload more versions of your service click on the one you are interested and
then click on the three aligned button at the top right corner and click on **Add Version**.

![Add pricing version](/img/space/starter-guide/add-pricing-version.png)


A dialog will prompt you to upload a new **Pricing2Yaml** file. Make sure the `saasName`
field matches your service exactly, and the `version` field is unique compared to previous
versions for that service.


![Add service](/img/space/starter-guide/add-new-service-dialog.png)


## Pricing Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active : Pricing created
    Active --> Archived : Pricing archived
    Archived --> Active : Pricing actived
    Archived --> [*] : Service disabled
```

<details>

<summary>**Usage in terminal**</summary>

Using your terminal go to the location where you cloned the SPACE repository and make the following
request:

```bash
curl -H 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
  --form pricing=@api/src/test/data/pricings/petclinic-2025.yml \
  http://localhost:5403/api/v1/services
```

This command will submit a form with a field `pricing` containing the Pricing2Yaml file
you specify in the path `@your/file/path`, in our case, `api/src/test/data/pricings/petclinic-2025.yml` file.


`POST /api/v1/users` request simplified:

```http
POST /api/v1/services HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5403
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=example
x-api-key: <your_api_key>

--example
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="pricing"; filename="petclinic-2025.yml"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

saasName: Petclinic
syntaxVersion: "3.0"
etc...
--example--
```

If you have successfully make the request you will see the following JSON body
confirming the upload:

```json
{
  "name": "Petclinic",
  "disabled": false,
  "activePricings": {
    "2025-3-26": {
      "id": "68907e381570b332f02d05c1",
      "_id": "68907e381570b332f02d05c4"
    }
  },
  "_id": "68907e381570b332f02d05c3",
  "__v": 0
}
```
