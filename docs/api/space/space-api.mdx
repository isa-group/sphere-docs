# 📖 SPACE OpenAPI Specification

This section provides the official **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)** for SPACE. It describes the available endpoints, request/response formats, and data models that developers can use to integrate with SPACE.  

You can use this specification to:

- 📌 Explore the API endpoints and their expected inputs/outputs.  
- ⚙️ Generate client SDKs in your preferred language.  
- 🧪 Test API calls directly with tools like Swagger UI, Postman, or cURL.  

The goal of this specification is to ensure **clarity, consistency, and automation** when building services that rely on SPACE’s feature evaluation and subscription management.
