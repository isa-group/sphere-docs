# Pricing-driven Development and Operation

## Overview  

Specification languages for APIs (such as [OAS](https://swagger.io/specification/)) allow providers to formally describe an API’s functional aspects. Once expressed in such a format, the specification can be reused across multiple life-cycle tasks like documentation, testing, or validation.  

By analogy, SaaS **pricings** –which capture both functional and extra-functional aspects– can also be leveraged in a similar way. **Pricing-driven Development and Operation** advocates precisely this shift: moving from the traditional conception of pricings as purely commercial structures to treating them as machine-oriented artifacts –[iPricings](./iPricing.md)– whose information can be systematically exploited to address the challenges derived from pricings in SaaS, such as pricing validation, identifying optimal configurations for specific user needs, etc.

The **[iPricing metamodel](./iPricing.md)** constitutes the first formalization of pricings in this direction, while its YAML-based serialization, [Pricing2Yaml](../pricing-description-languages/Pricing2Yaml/the-pricing2yaml-syntax.md), brings this vision into practice.

## Benefits  

Adopting this approach unlocks several opportunities for both providers and developers:

- **Richer pricing & subscription modeling**  
  Enables more expressive representations, paving the way for standardization and reusable tooling.  

- **Methodologies for “pricification”**  
  Systematic design of consistent, manageable, and profitable pricings, supported by reusable pricing patterns.  

- **Pricing-driven self-adaptation**  
  Ensures that user access dynamically aligns with the constraints of their subscription.  

- **Subscription compliance testing**  
  Automates tests to guarantee that feature toggles remain consistent with pricing constraints.

- **Automated analysis of iPricings**  
  Facilitates tasks like configuration space exploration, optimal configuration search, and design-time error detection.

In essence, pricing-driven DevOps reframes pricings as **first-class operational artifacts**, turning them into a foundation for automation, testing, analysis, and self-adaptation across software life cycle.
