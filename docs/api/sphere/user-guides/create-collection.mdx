# ➕ Create a Collection

Pricings can be part of a *collection*. These elements are useful for
organizing several versions of the same pricing plan, by analogy they are the equivalent
to **folders** in an OS.

## 0. Prerequisites

:::warning
To upload a pricing to SPHERE, you must have a **registered account**.
:::

## 1. Navigate to your profile

Go to your profile page, in the case that you don't have any collection registered in
your profile a button will appear asking you to create one:

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img src={NoCollections} width="900" />
    <figcaption style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>An account with no collections registered</figcaption>
</figure>


In the case that you already have registered collections, you can add one by clicking the ✚ button in
the upper right corner of the collections list.

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img src={AddCollectionIcon} width="600" />
    <figcaption style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>Add collection icon</figcaption>
</figure>

## 2. Create a collection

When you click the ➕ button a form will appear. You will need to provide the following information:
- Collection name
- Collection description
- Choose collection visibility
- A section to add pricings to the collection (Manually or in bulk)

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <img src={CollectionForm} width="600" />
    <figcaption style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>View of the collection creation form</figcaption>
</figure>


:::info Collection visibility
A collection's visibility can be set to one of two states:

- **public**: any user will be able to view your collection at the [Pricings](https://sphere.score.us.es/pricings) search page
- **private**: you will only be able to your collection  in SPHERE. 
:::

When you have finished filling the data click the **ADD COLLECTION** button.

:::info Pricing assignment methods for collections

You can add a pricing to a collection in two ways:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">
    If you have already uploaded **pricing** to your profile, they will not be assigned to any collection by default.
    To assign a pricing plan to a **collection**, click on it (a ✅ will appear, indicating that the plan has been selected).
    If you don't want to include it, click again to deselect it.

    <figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
        <img src={AddPricingManualMode} />
        <figcaption style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>Selection of unassigned pricings</figcaption>
    </figure>

    In your profile view, you can also assign a pricing to a collection individually if you select **Add to collection** action by clicking
    on the three dots (⋮) of a pricing item.

    <figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
        <img src={ProfileAddToCollection} width="500" />
        <figcaption style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>Add to collection in Unassigned pricing section</figcaption>
    </figure>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bulk" label="In bulk">
    Instead of uploading each pricing plan individually and assigning it to a collection, you can **upload** a
    `.zip` file containing all the pricings of your collection **at once**. You will need to create a folder on
    your computer containing all the Pricing2Yaml files. Then, compress the folder into a `.zip` file and upload it to SPHERE.
    
    Here is an example of a valid folder structure:
    ```txt title="petclinic.zip"
    └── petclinic/
        ├── 2023-petclinic.yaml
        ├── 2024-petclinic.yaml
        └── 2025-petclinic.yaml
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

## 3. View your collection

The created collection will appear in the section **Collections** in your profile (you
change the settings of your collection if you click inside that item):

<figure style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
  <img src={CollectionCreated} />
  <figcaption style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>The created collection appears on your profile page</figcaption>
</figure>
