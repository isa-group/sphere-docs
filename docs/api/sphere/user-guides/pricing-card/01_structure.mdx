# Structure

We can divide the pricing plan information page into two sections: on the left,
the pricing plan itself, and on the right, several panels with complementary information.

## Pricing information

In this section, you can view the rendered pricing information from the Pricing2Yaml file you uploaded.
It follows the standard structure of a pricing table: the Y-axis lists the features, the X-axis lists
the plans, and each cell indicates whether a feature is available for a given plan or specifies its
usage limit. At the bottom, you'll find the add-ons that can be optionally purchased.

:::info
If your pricing belongs to a collection, you can switch between different pricings using
the **Version** selector in the top-right corner of the view.
