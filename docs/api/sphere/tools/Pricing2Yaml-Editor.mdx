# Pricing2Yaml Editor

The [Pricing2Yaml editor](https://sphere.score.us.es/editor) enables users to **edit** and **preview** their **Pricing2Yaml** files directly in the browser. As you make changes, the tool renders **real-time updates** to the pricing, making it easy to design your **pricing** layout and quickly spot and correct errors by reviewing the feature matrix.

:::warning
The Pricing2Yaml editor is compatible only with version `3.0` of the [Pricing2Yaml](../../pricing-description-languages/Pricing2Yaml/versions/pricing2yaml-v30-specification.mdx) syntax.
:::

You can **access** the Pricing2Yaml editor through the SPHERE web by navigating to the *Tools* section and selecting *Pricing2Yaml Editor* at the top of the navigation bar, or by visiting https://sphere.score.us.es/editor directly in your browser.

:::info
